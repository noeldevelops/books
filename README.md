# Rubber Ducks Bookshelf

Website: https://rubber-ducks-book-club.netlify.app/

This is a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) that displays the books we've read for the [Rubber Ducks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rubber-ducks-nm) Book Club. It fetches the data at build time from [a Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xZfBupIyI0MezvG-8iACqHrzTrlNt4jqRYGuUZdrp-A/edit?usp=sharing) that we maintain to keep track of the books we've read in the past or are going to read in the future.

The site deploys to Netlify automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
